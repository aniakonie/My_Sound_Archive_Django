    <h3>How My Sound Archive works</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
        As a default My Sound Archive retrieves from your Spotify account all tracks that are:<br>
        - your liked songs (all songs included in your “Liked Songs” playlist),<br>
        - members of playlists that you have created.<br>
        <br>
        If some of your liked songs show up in your playlists as well, don't worry - My Sound Archive takes care of this and won't show any duplicated songs in your collection.
        You can customize your archive contents later - exclude songs from some or all of your playlists.
        <br><br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline">My Sound Archive won't modify any of your data on Spotify</span> - there's simply no functionality in our app that could do that.
        You can change the contents of your collection only by adding new songs on Spotify.
    </p>

    <h3>Why does My Sound Archive provide a better way of displaying your music library than Spotify?</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
        <p>Spotify is renowned for its highly effective music recommendation algorithm, yet the user's library lacks methods
            for organizing its content. While it's easy to discover new music to add to your collection, it becomes increasingly
            challenging to keep track of it.</p>
        
        <p>Unless you search through a long list of liked songs or artists when selecting something to listen to, there's
        a risk of missing a significant portion of your content. While it's possible to organize songs into playlists,
        adding them all to playlists isn't a practical solution. Playlists can be organized into folders but unfortunately
        this feature is not extended to artists who the user follows.</p>
